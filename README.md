# Diploma Paper: Cancer Detection and Classification
## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for my diploma paper on "Cancer Detection and Classification." The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient method for detecting and classifying cancer using gene expression data.

## Project Structure

* **data**: This directory contains the gene expression datasets used in the project. It includes both diseased and healthy samples obtained from various sources.

* **code**: This directory contains the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

* **models**: This directory stores the trained models, including their weights and configurations.

* **results**: This directory contains the results and performance metrics obtained from the trained models.

* **docs**: This directory holds the documentation and related resources for the project.
## Setup and Dependencies
To reproduce the experiments and run the code in this project, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
```
